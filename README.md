# Chatbot
Chatbot app
-----------
In this Python project,I built a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses.I used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then I gave a random response from the list of responses.
